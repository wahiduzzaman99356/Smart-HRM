## API Spec Update Rule
- When a module is changed (UI, behavior, workflow, fields, routes, or data contract), API spec updates are required.
- Before updating any API spec markdown, ask the user for confirmation first.
- Only proceed with API spec edits after explicit user approval.
- Keep all API spec markdown files under `docs/`.
